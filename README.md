# USACO Prep

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C++-blue)

## First Method

I committed 2 hours a day, starting on September 9th. I didn't know anything about competitive programming (CP) before this. Initially, I tried following the [usaco.guide](https://usaco.guide/) and solving problems, but I struggled to solve them. Now, I need to explore a different approach.

## Second Method

I was recommended to use [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and aim to solve about 30-40% of problems at a comfortable level. I'm planning to identify this level and start goin from there.

updating soon
